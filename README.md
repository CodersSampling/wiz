# Wiz

A simple, frameless, lightweight browser for screenshots

## Why Wiz?

Screenshoting a website for demo perpose has been developer's common task and it's sometime quite annoying to cut the image screenshoted from the frame of a browser and that's why I created this simple browser.

Wiz is built using [`tauri`](https://tauri.studio) framework and it's a cross-platform application. Also, unlike apps built on the top of Electron, it is lightweight! The installer is only 4MB. In addition, it's completely free.

## How to use?
You can start Wiz by running it via terminal. CLI Usage:

```bash
wiz [url to open]
```
example:
```bash
wiz https://google.com
```
